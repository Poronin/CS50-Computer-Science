sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: This algorithm is faster when data is sorted since its Omega is equal to n. The rest of the algorithms have the same upper bound and lower bound Theta.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: it is the faster algorithm when sorting higher volumes of data (Big O: log n)

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: This algorithm responds the same way for the same volume of data in all three scenarios: sorted, reversed and random.
